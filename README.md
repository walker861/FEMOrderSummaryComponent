## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

This is my second Frontend Mentor project. I used the :hover pseudo class which was new to me from the NFT card challenge. On the first challenge I tried on Frontend Mentor, I was unaware of using this pseudoclass. Additionally, I used the hsl color value to produce the changes in color for the hover state. 

Also, the use of the background-image property was new to me. It took several attempts for me to position and size this properly.


### Continued development

I still have a limited working knowledge of CSS and HTML. I plan to continue working on the Frontend Mentor challenges in the "Newbie" difficulty to improve my layout skills.
